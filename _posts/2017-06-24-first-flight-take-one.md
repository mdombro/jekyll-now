So this morning I went out to test fly the new RC plane. However, I had accidently unbound the transmitter from the receiver in the plane - and only realized that at the field. Trying to hack something together resulted in the ESC getting fried and almost catching on fire. I have already ordered new parts however I luckily have a replacement ESC on hand that will work in the interim - just have to be careful how much throttle I use. 

Below is a picture of the fried ESC. The brownish part is an inductor that saw too much current and quit working. If only there was short circuit protection for that...
