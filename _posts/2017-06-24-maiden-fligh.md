The wind calmed down today and I had a chance to actually fly the new plane. Overall it went well - it is certainly a manuverable little craft. Some notes on things to improve are moving the center of gravity futher forward, the plane felt like it was always on the edge of falling over and crashing. In addition, it really does not like wind, at all. Every small gust buffets it around and makes flying not quite as enjoyable. Other thoughts are that if using a 2S LiPo a large 9x4 prop will be needed. At the moment the 8x4 works great with 3S batteries but is severely underpowered on 2S.
