title: RC airplane Build
---

So over the past few days I have been putting together an RC plane kit. The kit was found at HobbyKing [here](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tm-reaktor-3d-epp-800mm-arf.html) for a great price. It is made from EPP foam which is extermely flexible and durable - good for crashes which I will inevitabely have while learning more aerobatic flight.

I went with an Emax 1700kv motor, 12A ESC, and both 2- and 3- cell 850mAh LiPo batteries. I have a 5 channel receiver with the housing stripped off to save some weight. Everything is glued together with foam safe Bob Smith Industries CA glue with accelerator to speed up the drying process. Overall this is a pretty powerful setup for this kit but it still comes in at a lightweight 292 grams (270 g with the smaller 2-cell batter). Hoping to maiden tomorrow if the wind is low.
