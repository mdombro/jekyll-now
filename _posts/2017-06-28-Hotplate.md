As I get closer to restarting my hobby electronics adventures, I realize I need a hotplate to reflow PCBs. Rather than buying something pre-built, I'm figuring I will go with a DIY solution and build something with PID control and accurate temperature monitoring and control. 

Basic idea is going to be to take a standard small kitchen hot plate (like the one below), mount a thermocouple onto it, drive it by an SSR (solid state relay), and have everything controlled by a tiny microcontroller and a PC program.
