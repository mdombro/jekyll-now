As I get closer to restarting my hobby electronics adventures, I realize I need a hotplate to reflow PCBs. Rather than buying something pre-built, I'm figuring I will go with a DIY solution and build something with PID control and accurate temperature monitoring and control. 

Basic idea starts with a typical kitchen hot plate, like the one pictured below:

(yes that's the one I have)

and removing the larger burner. I went ahead and pulled this cooker apart and cut out the large burner, which turned out to be a large 'puck' that was basically a cast iron and ceramic package with an embedded heating element. This heating element was suprissingly powerful, some text on the underside denotes it is 900W. Given some experiments I conducted on heating time it can heat at a little over 1 degree C per second, exactly what is needed for solder reflowing. And as for max temp, I've clocked it at over 800 F. Considering only 300-400 F is needed for reflow ever this element will more than suffice.

Next steps are to design and build an enclosure for the puck, including a fan mounted under it for rapid cooling if needed. And of course the design and programming of the control circuitry. I already have some of the code done for the microcontroller side of things, I will post some updated on that tomorrow.
